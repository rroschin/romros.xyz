                <h3>Different Projects</h3>
                <p>
                  As of today, I have participated in more than 15 different projects.
                  I started my career in telecom practice.
                  Then I worked mostly in financial practice.
                  Later I took part in projects from travel and media practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was involved in all stages of these projects starting from presales activities and initial architecture to technical support after
                  production version is released.
                  This gave me a good vision of a typical project life-cycle and understanding of what should be done in order to deliver a successful
                  product.
                </p>

              <div class="expertise-item">
                <h3>Java Stack</h3>
                <p>
                  I started to learn Java at university, then continued to gather experience in a real project.
                  Since then, I have been using Java as my primary language, constantly learning new frameworks, libraries and approaches.
                  Recent JDK releases gave the platform a new start, so I always try to be informed about what is new and how to use new things in my
                  projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for now I completed more than 15 Projects using Java technology with a variety of tools and libraries.
                </p>

              <div class="expertise-item">
                <h3>Node.Js Stack</h3>
                <p>
                  Since I was familiar with JavaScript language, Node.js (as JavaScript on server side) looked as a good opportunity to try.
                  Using back-end development principles I successfully completed several projects with Node.js stack.
                  For all projects I used the latest version of Node.js as well as Express.js framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since writing server side code on JavaScript could be sometimes tricky, I try to stick with common patterns like Promises, async.js,
                  async/await, classes, generators and so on.
                </p>

                <h3>Software Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                  In recent years I have started to participate in software architecture phases of projects more often.
                  Experience and skills that I have now allow me to have a clear understanding of functional and non-functional requirements of a
                  future product and create the best possible solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This area is new for me and there are still many things that needs to be learned and structurized, I am keen to learn more about
                  Software Architecture use my knowledge in practice.

                        <strong>Description:</strong> Joined a team of SDETs with a vision to bring a more structural approach to software development,
						organize development practices, apply programming best practices, improve scalability and code maintainability based on
						10+ years of experience. Started from code organization, introduced modularity, shared functionality, successfully applied
						these practices. Continued with writing a subsystem that checks and brings a set of devices to the desired state before running
						a series of tests on them, made the subsystem scalable, so it could be applied to any device models in any environment.
						Replaced a static-timer-wait approach in multi-device tests (e.g. calling, group calling, etc.) with an event-based approach,
						significantly improving tests reliability and performance. Participated in creating internal “Standards and Conventions”
						that should be applied to automated tests. Have been doing continuous refactoring and improving code readability, hands-on code
						reviews and mentoring less experienced developers, teaching SDETs java programming best practices. Participated in the software
						design of new project features and PoC subprojects

                        for a complex hotel managements system, stabilized the project in first six months, and developed a set of new features as
                        well as technological upgrades of the existing system in next six months. For the project, that is a set of systems: Hotel
                        Chain Website, Booking Engine, CMS, Admin Portal, 3pty services integration components (Booking.com, Expedia, Maestro, Oracle
                        OPERA, etc.)Created design and architecture for new system components and their interactions with the existing project.
                        Introduced code quality standards to the project and trained the team to follow them, actively participated in code reviews
                        and team collaborations. Made performance review of existing web services and improved overall performance (x10 faster) and
                        stability. Upgraded project components to recent versions of dependencies including JDK. Covered the existing modules with
                        tests, drastically increasing test coverage and stability of the system.

                        preparation for a database migration process. Quickly obtained required knowledge, updated and improved database (Cassandra to
                        MariaDB) migration scenario, scripts and back-end services. Successfully migrated data to new storage in short window of 4
                        hours, analyzed and fixed data inconsistency issues. Made performance testing of old version of the system and compared it to
                        the new values, also improved 70% of existing database queries, though improving user experience. After stabilization phase,
                        implemented a set of new features, which allowed releasing new version of the product and attracting 3 times more users.
                        Created project documentation. Added Jenkins pipelines for test and production deploy, which allowed to decrease deploy time
                        from 30 minutes to 2 minutes.

                        hackathon project. The project represents an intersection of IoT and Blockchain technologies. The idea of the project is to
                        create an application that is able to collect information about “green energy” produced by private houses (e.g. wind turbines
                        or solar panels). As a primary back-end developer, created architecture of the solution. During 48 hours of coding, developed
                        the product and presented it to the jury of the hackathon. Used Node.js technology with Ethereum as Blockchain and Solidity as
                        a language for smart contracts. Additionally, integrated the application with AWS IoT service to support different kinds of
                        “green-energy” devices. Implemented features like the ability to add new equipment to running system and connect it to the
                        public Blockchain network. Also implemented a feature for users of the system to convert “green-energy” into internal
                        Blockchain currency, which can later be used to buy goods from organic product suppliers.

                        <strong>Description:</strong> As a tech lead of a small team of developers, designed and implemented a secure mechanism for
                        money transfers and personal finance management system for a UK government organization. Created an initial version of
                        architecture for fast delivery of the PoC version of a product to the market. Working with a team, developed a set of back-end
                        services and UI that allow the government organization to transfer funds to recipients. Integrated the platform with banking
                        APIs (ISO 20022).
                        </br> As a lead developer, continued to improve the PoC version and create stable releases of the platform, so it went to
                        production state. Improved the existing architecture of the platform. Developed many new features: the ability to manage money
                        via mobile application, buy goods of a particular category in authorized stores via a custom POS terminal API, and transfer
                        money to other users within the application.
